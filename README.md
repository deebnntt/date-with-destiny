Goal: To make date planning easier by providing three activities (day activity, dining, and nightlife) generated randomly based on user location input

+ Uses Ruby on Rails for front and back ends
+ Fetches data from the Foursquare API for the various activities and parsed through results to create custom activity list
+ Users can edit or delete their plans
+ User interface designed with custom CSS and graphics
+ Uses Foursquare2 for Foursquare fetch - https://github.com/mattmueller/foursquare2
